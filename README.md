#  Bumble Bee Movies

A shopping website for movies!

## :nerd_face: Motivation

This project was created as our initial project for the senior phase of Fullstack Academy. We were tasked with building a shopping website that implemented cart functionality.

## :shopping_cart: Functionality

* Users can sign-in or login with e-mail address and password
* Users can view all movies available for sale
* Users can view individual movies and their description
* A User can add movies to their cart for purchase
* A User can check their cart to see all current movies added to their cart
* A User can checkout and see a total purchase amount and current items in their cart

## :hammer_and_pick: Built With

Bumble Bee Movies’ front-end was built with React, React-Redux, and CSS. Modular React components allowed for easy design implementation throughout. Redux allowed us to keep track of our state and manage our cart.

Bumble Bee Movies’ back-end was built with Node.js, PostgreSQL, Express, and Sequelize. We used PostgreSQL as our database, Express to handle our middleware and API routes, and Sequelize as our ORM. Heroku was used for the deployment of our app.
